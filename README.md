# Vaccinica

Downloads and presents covid data publicly available from data.gov.ro

http://bit.ly/vaccinica

Explore https://data.gov.ro/dataset/transparenta-covid data and get informed
of the available vaccination statistics in Romania. Would be nice to receive
data pre March 2020.

Please review the code to help me fix potential mistakes.

## Running locally

Automatically download and convert the data from data.gov.ro

```
yarn install
yarn download
yarn dl2json
```

Serve `docs` folder though a http server

```
cd docs && python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000
google-chome http://localhost:8000
```

### Docker

Alternatively, if you have Docker installed, you can run the application this way:
```bash
./scripts/run.sh
```

This will instantiate a local container starting from the same image used for deployment on Github pages and execute the yarn commands above. If you are using VS Code, you can also hook it to the workspace inside the container.

## Roadmap

* [x] download data with a script
* [x] github pages
* [x] filter counties
